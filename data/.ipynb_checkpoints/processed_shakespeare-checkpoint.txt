thou abuse<sep>the bounteous largess given thee to give<sep>profitless usurer why dost thou use<sep>so great a sum of sums yet canst not live<sep>for having traffic with thy self alone<sep>thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive<sep>then how when nature calls thee to be gone<sep>what acceptable audit canst thou leave<sep>thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee<sep>which used lives th

what could death do if thou shouldst depart<sep>leaving thee living in posterity<sep>be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair<sep>to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir<sep>~<sep>lo in the orient when the gracious light<sep>lifts up his burning head each under eye<sep>doth homage to his newappearing sight<sep>serving with looks his sacred majesty<sep>and having climbed the steepup

that thou bearst love to any<sep>who for thy self art so unprovident<sep>grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many<sep>but that thou none lovst is most evident<sep>for thou art so possessed with murdrous hate<sep>that gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire<sep>seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate<sep>which to repair should be thy chief desire<sep>o change thy thought that i may change my mind<sep>shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love<sep>be as thy presence is gracious and kind<sep>or to thy self at least kindhearted prove<sep>make thee another self for love of me<sep>that beauty still may live in thine or thee<sep>~<sep>as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst<sep>in one of thine from that which thou departest<sep>and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst<sep>thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest<sep>herein lives wisdom beauty and increase<sep>without this folly age and cold decay<sep>if all were minded so the times should cease<sep>and threescore year would make the world away<sep>let those whom nature hath not made for store<sep>harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish<sep>look whom she best endowed she gave thee more<sep>which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish<sep>she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby<sep>thou shouldst print more not let that copy die<sep>~<sep>when i do count the clock that tells the time<sep>and see the brave day sunk in hideous night<sep>when i behold the violet past prime<sep>and sable curls all silvered oer with white<sep>when lofty trees i see barren of leaves<sep>which erst from heat did canopy the herd<sep>and summers green all girded up in sheaves<sep>borne on the bier with white and bristly beard<sep>then of thy beauty do i question make<sep>that thou among the wastes of time must go<sep>since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake<sep>and die as fast as they see others grow<sep>and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence<sep>save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence<sep>~<sep>o that you were your self but love you are<sep>no longer yours than you your self here live<sep>against this coming end you should prepare<sep>and your sweet semblance to some other give<sep>so should that beauty which you hold in lease<sep>find no determination then you were<sep>your self again after your selfs decease<sep>when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear<sep>who lets so fair a house fall to decay<sep>which husbandry in honour might uphold<sep>against the stormy gusts of winters day<sep>and barren rage of deaths eternal cold<sep>o none but unthrifts dear my love you know<sep>you had a father let your son say so<sep>~<sep>not from the stars do i my judgement pluck<sep>and yet methinks i have astronomy<sep>but not to tell of good or evil luck<sep>of plagues of dearths or seasons quality<sep>nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell<sep>pointing to each his thunder rain and wind<sep>or say with princes if it shall go well<sep>by oft predict that i in heaven find<sep>but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive<sep>and constant stars in them i read such art<sep>as truth and beauty shall together thrive<sep>if from thy self to store thou wouldst convert<sep>or else of thee this i prognosticate<sep>thy end is truths and beautys doom and date<sep>~<sep>when i consider every thing that grows<sep>holds in perfection but a little moment<sep>that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows<sep>whereon the stars in secret influence comment<sep>when i perceive that men as plants increase<sep>cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky<sep>vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease<sep>and wear their brave state out of memory<sep>then the conceit of this inconstant stay<sep>sets you most rich in youth before my sight<sep>where wasteful time debateth with decay<sep>to change your day of youth to sullied night<sep>and all in war with time for love of you<sep>as he takes from you i engraft you new<sep>~<sep>but wherefore do not you a mightier way<sep>make war upon this bloody tyrant time<sep>and fortify your self in your decay<sep>with means more blessed than my barren rhyme<sep>now stand you on the top of happy hours<sep>and many maiden gardens yet unset<sep>with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers<sep>much liker than your painted counterfeit<sep>so should the lines of life that life repair<sep>which this times pencil or my pupil pen<sep>neither in inward worth nor outward fair<sep>can make you live your self in eyes of men<sep>to give away your self keeps your self still<sep>and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill<sep>~<sep>who will believe my verse in time to come<sep>if it were filled with your most high deserts<sep>though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb<sep>which hides your life and shows not half your parts<sep>if i could write the beauty of your eyes<sep>and in fresh numbers number all your graces<sep>the age to come would say this poet lies<sep>such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces<sep>so should my papers yellowed with their age<sep>be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue<sep>and your true rights be termed a poets rage<sep>and stretched metre of an antique song<sep>but were some child of yours alive that time<sep>you should live twice in it and in my rhyme<sep>~<sep>shall i compare thee to a summers day<sep>thou art more lovely and more temperate<sep>rough winds do shake the darling buds of may<sep>and summers lease hath all too short a date<sep>sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines<sep>and often is his gold complexion dimmed<sep>and every fair from fair sometime declines<sep>by chance or natures changing course untrimmed<sep>but thy eternal summer shall not fade<sep>nor lose possession of that fair thou owst<sep>nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade<sep>when in eternal lines to time thou growst<sep>so long as men can breathe or eyes can see<sep>so long lives this and this gives life to thee<sep>~<sep>devouring time blunt thou the lions paws<sep>and make the earth devour her own sweet brood<sep>pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws<sep>and burn the longlived phoenix in her blood<sep>make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst<sep>and do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted time<sep>to the wide world and all her fading sweets<sep>but i forbid thee one most heinous crime<sep>o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow<sep>nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen<sep>him in thy course untainted do allow<sep>for beautys pattern to succeeding men<sep>yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong<sep>my love shall in my verse ever live young<sep>~<sep>a womans face with natures own hand painted<sep>hast thou the master mistress of my passion<sep>a womans gentle heart but not acquainted<sep>with shifting change as is false womens fashion<sep>an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling<sep>gilding the object whereupon it gazeth<sep>a man in hue all hues in his controlling<sep>which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth<sep>and for a woman wert thou first created<sep>till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting<sep>and by addition me of thee defeated<sep>by adding one thing to my purpose nothing<sep>but since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure<sep>mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure<sep>~<sep>so is it not with me as with that muse<sep>stirred by a painted beauty to his verse<sep>who heaven it self for ornament doth use<sep>and every fair with his fair doth rehearse<sep>making a couplement of proud compare<sep>with sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems<sep>with aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare<sep>that heavens air in this huge rondure hems<sep>o let me true in love but truly write<sep>and then believe me my love is as fair<sep>as any mothers child though not so bright<sep>as those gold candles fixed in heavens air<sep>let them say more that like of hearsay well<sep>i will not praise that purpose not to sell<sep>~<sep>my glass shall not persuade me i am old<sep>so long as youth and thou are of one date<sep>but when in thee times furrows i behold<sep>then look i death my days should expiate<sep>for all that beauty that doth cover thee<sep>is but the seemly raiment of my heart<sep>which in thy breast doth live as thine in me<sep>how can i then be elder than thou art<sep>o therefore love be of thyself so wary<sep>as i not for my self but for thee will<sep>bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary<sep>as tender nurse her babe from faring ill<sep>presume not on thy heart when mine is slain<sep>thou gavst me thine not to give back again<sep>~<sep>as an unperfect actor on the stage<sep>who with his fear is put beside his part<sep>or some fierce thing replete with too much rage<sep>whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart<sep>so i for fear of trust forget to say<sep>the perfect ceremony of loves rite<sep>and in mine own loves strength seem to decay<sep>oercharged with burthen of mine own loves might<sep>o let my looks be then the eloquence<sep>and dumb presagers of my speaking breast<sep>who plead for love and look for recompense<sep>more than that tongue that more hath more expressed<sep>o learn to read what silent love hath writ<sep>to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit<sep>~<sep>mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled<sep>thy beautys form in table of my heart<sep>my body is the frame wherein tis held<sep>and perspective it is best painters art<sep>for through the painter must you see his skill<sep>to find where your true image pictured lies<sep>which in my bosoms shop is hanging still<sep>that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes<sep>now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done<sep>mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me<sep>are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun<sep>delights to peep to gaze therein on thee<sep>yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art<sep>they draw but what they see know not the heart<sep>~<sep>let those who are in favour with their stars<sep>of public honour and proud titles boast<sep>whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars<sep>unlooked for joy in that i honour most<sep>great princes favourites their fair leaves spread<sep>but as the marigold at the suns eye<sep>and in themselves their pride lies buried<sep>for at a frown they in their glory die<sep>the painful warrior famoused for fight<sep>after a thousand victories once foiled<sep>is from the book of honour razed quite<sep>and all the rest forgot for which he toiled<sep>then happy i that love and am beloved<sep>where i may not remove nor be removed<sep>~<sep>lord of my love to whom in vassalage<sep>thy merit hath my duty strongly knit<sep>to thee i send this written embassage<sep>to witness duty not to show my wit<sep>duty so great which wit so poor as mine<sep>may make seem bare in wanting words to show it<sep>but that i hope some good conceit of thine<sep>in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it<sep>till whatsoever star that guides my moving<sep>points on me graciously with fair aspect<sep>and puts apparel on my tattered loving<sep>to show me worthy of thy sweet respect<sep>then may i dare to boast how i do love thee<sep>till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me<sep>~<sep>weary with toil i haste me to my bed<sep>the dear respose for limbs with travel tired<sep>but then begins a journey in my head<sep>to work my mind when bodys works expired<sep>for then my thoughts from far where i abide<sep>intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee<sep>and keep my drooping eyelids open wide<sep>looking on darkness which the blind do see<sep>save that my souls imaginary sight<sep>presents thy shadow to my sightless view<sep>which like a jewel hung in ghastly night<sep>makes black night beauteous and her old face new<sep>lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind<sep>for thee and for my self no quiet find<sep>~<sep>how can i then return in happy plight<sep>that am debarred the benefit of rest<sep>when days oppression is not eased by night<sep>but day by night and night by day oppressed<sep>and each though enemies to eithers reign<sep>do in consent shake hands to torture me<sep>the one by toil the other to complain<sep>how far i toil still farther off from thee<sep>i tell the day to please him thou art bright<sep>and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven<sep>so flatter i the swartcomplexioned night<sep>when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even<sep>but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer<sep>and night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger<sep>~<sep>when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes<sep>i all alone beweep my outcast state<sep>and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries<sep>and look upon my self and curse my fate<sep>wishing me like to one more rich in hope<sep>featured like him like him with friends possessed<sep>desiring this mans art and that mans scope<sep>with what i most enjoy contented least<sep>yet in these thoughts my self almost despising<sep>haply i think on thee and then my state<sep>like to the lark at break of day arising<sep>from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate<sep>for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings<sep>that then i scorn to change my state with kings<sep>~<sep>when to the sessions of sweet silent thought<sep>i summon up remembrance of things past<sep>i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought<sep>and with old woes new wail my dear times waste<sep>then can i drown an eye unused to flow<sep>for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night<sep>and weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe<sep>and moan th expense of many a vanished sight<sep>then can i grieve at grievances foregone<sep>and heavily from woe to woe tell oer<sep>the sad account of forebemoaned moan<sep>which i new pay as if not paid before<sep>but if the while i think on thee dear friend<sep>all losses are restored and sorrows end<sep>~<sep>thy bosom is endeared with all hearts<sep>which i by lacking have supposed dead<sep>and there reigns love and all loves loving parts<sep>and all those friends which i thought buried<sep>how many a holy and obsequious tear<sep>hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye<sep>as interest of the dead which now appear<sep>but things removed that hidden in thee lie<sep>thou art the grave where buried love doth live<sep>hung with the trophies of my lovers gone<sep>who all their parts of me to thee did give<sep>that due of many now is thine alone<sep>their images i loved i view in thee<sep>and thou all they hast all the all of me<sep>~<sep>if thou survive my wellcontented day<sep>when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover<sep>and shalt by fortune once more resurvey<sep>these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover<sep>compare them with the bettring of the time<sep>and though they be outstripped by every pen<sep>reserve them for my love not for their rhyme<sep>exceeded by the height of happier men<sep>o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought<sep>had my friends muse grown with this growing age<sep>a dearer birth than this his love had brought<sep>to march in ranks of better equipage<sep>but since he died and poets better prove<sep>theirs for their style ill read his for his love<sep>~<sep>full many a glorious morning have i seen<sep>flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye<sep>kissing with golden face the meadows green<sep>gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy<sep>anon permit the basest clouds to ride<sep>with ugly rack on his celestial face<sep>and from the forlorn world his visage hide<sep>stealing unseen to west with this disgrace<sep>even so my sun one early morn did shine<sep>with all triumphant splendour on my brow<sep>but out alack he was but one hour mine<sep>the region cloud hath masked him from me now<sep>yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth<sep>suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth<sep>~<sep>why didst thou promise such a beauteous day<sep>and make me travel forth without my cloak<sep>to let base clouds oertake me in my way<sep>hiding thy bravry in their rotten smoke<sep>tis not enough that through the cloud thou break<sep>to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face<sep>for no man well of such a salve can speak<sep>that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace<sep>nor can thy shame give physic to my grief<sep>though thou repent yet i have still the loss<sep>th offenders sorrow lends but weak relief<sep>to him that bears the strong offences cross<sep>ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds<sep>and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds<sep>~<sep>no more be grieved at that which thou hast done<sep>roses have thorns and silver fountains mud<sep>clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun<sep>and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud<sep>all men make faults and even i in this<sep>authorizing thy trespass with compare<sep>my self corrupting salving thy amiss<sep>excusing thy sins more than thy sins are<sep>for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense<sep>thy adverse party is thy advocate<sep>and gainst my self a lawful plea commence<sep>such civil war is in my love and hate<sep>that i an accessary needs must be<sep>to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me<sep>~<sep>let me confess that we two must be twain<sep>although our undivided loves are one<sep>so shall those blots that do with me remain<sep>without thy help by me be borne alone<sep>in our two loves there is but one respect<sep>though in our lives a separable spite<sep>which though it alter not loves sole effect<sep>yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight<sep>i may not evermore acknowledge thee<sep>lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame<sep>nor thou with public kindness honour me<sep>unless thou take that honour from thy name<sep>but do not so i love thee in such sort<sep>as thou being mine mine is thy good report<sep>~<sep>as a decrepit father takes delight<sep>to see his active child do deeds of youth<sep>so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite<sep>take all my comfort of thy worth and truth<sep>for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit<sep>or any of these all or all or more<sep>entitled in thy parts do crowned sit<sep>i make my love engrafted to this store<sep>so then i am not lame poor nor despised<sep>whilst that this shadow doth such substance give<sep>that i in thy abundance am sufficed<sep>and by a part of all thy glory live<sep>look what is best that best i wish in thee<sep>this wish i have then ten times happy me<sep>~<sep>how can my muse want subject to invent<sep>while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse<sep>thine own sweet argument too excellent<sep>for every vulgar paper to rehearse<sep>o give thy self the thanks if aught in me<sep>worthy perusal stand against thy sight<sep>for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee<sep>when thou thy self dost give invention light<sep>be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth<sep>than those old nine which rhymers invocate<sep>and he that calls on thee let him bring forth<sep>eternal numbers to outlive long date<sep>if my slight muse do please these curious days<sep>the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise<sep>~<sep>o how thy worth with manners may i sing<sep>when thou art all the better part of me<sep>what can mine own praise to mine own self bring<sep>and what ist but mine own when i praise thee<sep>even for this let us divided live<sep>and our dear love lose name of single one<sep>that by this separation i may give<sep>that due to thee which thou deservst alone<sep>o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove<sep>were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave<sep>to entertain the time with thoughts of love<sep>which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive<sep>and that thou teachest how to make one twain<sep>by praising him here who doth hence remain<sep>~<sep>take all my loves my love yea take them all<sep>what hast thou then more than thou hadst before<sep>no love my love that thou mayst true love call<sep>all mine was thine before thou hadst this more<sep>then if for my love thou my love receivest<sep>i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest<sep>but yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest<sep>by wilful taste of what thy self refusest<sep>i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief<sep>although thou steal thee all my poverty<sep>and yet love knows it is a greater grief<sep>to bear greater wrong than hates known injury<sep>lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows<sep>kill me with spites yet we must not be foes<sep>~<sep>those pretty wrongs that liberty commits<sep>when i am sometime absent from thy heart<sep>thy beauty and thy years full well befits<sep>for still temptation follows where thou art<sep>gentle thou art and therefore to be won<sep>beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed<sep>and when a woman woos what womans son<sep>will sourly leave her till he have prevailed<sep>ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear<sep>and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth<sep>who lead thee in their riot even there<sep>where thou art forced to break a twofold truth<sep>hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee<sep>thine by thy beauty being false to me<sep>~<sep>that thou hast her it is not all my grief<sep>and yet it may be said i loved her dearly<sep>that she hath thee is of my wailing chief<sep>a loss in love that touches me more nearly<sep>loving offenders thus i will excuse ye<sep>thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her<sep>and for my sake even so doth she abuse me<sep>suffring my friend for my sake to approve her<sep>if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain<sep>and losing her my friend hath found that loss<sep>both find each other and i lose both twain<sep>and both for my sake lay on me this cross<sep>but heres the joy my friend and i are one<sep>sweet flattery then she loves but me alone<sep>~<sep>when most i wink then do mine eyes best see<sep>for all the day they view things unrespected<sep>but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee<sep>and darkly bright are bright in dark directed<sep>then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright<sep>how would thy shadows form form happy show<sep>to the clear day with thy much clearer light<sep>when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so<sep>how would i say mine eyes be blessed made<sep>by looking on thee in the living day<sep>when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade<sep>through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay<sep>all days are nights to see till i see thee<sep>and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me<sep>~<sep>if the dull substance of my flesh were thought<sep>injurious distance should not stop my way<sep>for then despite of space i would be brought<sep>from limits far remote where thou dost stay<sep>no matter then although my foot did stand<sep>upon the farthest earth removed from thee<sep>for nimble thought can jump both sea and land<sep>as soon as think the place where he would be<sep>but ah thought kills me that i am not thought<sep>to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone<sep>but that so much of earth and water wrought<sep>i must attend times leisure with my moan<sep>receiving nought by elements so slow<sep>but heavy tears badges of eithers woe<sep>~<sep>the other two slight air and purging fire<sep>are both with thee wherever i abide<sep>the first my thought the other my desire<sep>these presentabsent with swift motion slide<sep>for when these quicker elements are gone<sep>in tender embassy of love to thee<sep>my life being made of four with two alone<sep>sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy<sep>until lifes composition be recured<sep>by those swift messengers returned from thee<sep>who even but now come back again assured<sep>of thy fair health recounting it to me<sep>this told i joy but then no longer glad<sep>i send them back again and straight grow sad<sep>~<sep>mine eye and heart are at a mortal war<sep>how to divide the conquest of thy sight<sep>mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar<sep>my heart mine eye the freedom of that right<sep>my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie<sep>a closet never pierced with crystal eyes<sep>but the defendant doth that plea deny<sep>and says in him thy fair appearance lies<sep>to side this title is impanelled<sep>a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart<sep>and by their verdict is determined<sep>the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part<sep>as thus mine eyes due is thy outward part<sep>and my hearts right thy inward love of heart<sep>~<sep>betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took<sep>and each doth good turns now unto the other<sep>when that mine eye is famished for a look<sep>or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother<sep>with my loves picture then my eye doth feast<sep>and to the painted banquet bids my heart<sep>another time mine eye is my hearts guest<sep>and in his thoughts of love doth share a part<sep>so either by thy picture or my love<sep>thy self away art present still with me<sep>for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move<sep>and i am still with them and they with thee<sep>or if they sleep thy picture in my sight<sep>awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight<sep>~<sep>how careful was i when i took my way<sep>each trifle under truest bars to thrust<sep>that to my use it might unused stay<sep>from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust<sep>but thou to whom my jewels trifles are<sep>most worthy comfort now my greatest grief<sep>thou best of dearest and mine only care<sep>art left the prey of every vulgar thief<sep>thee have i not locked up in any chest<sep>save where thou art not though i feel thou art<sep>within the gentle closure of my breast<sep>from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part<sep>and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear<sep>for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear<sep>~<sep>against that time if ever that time come<sep>when i shall see thee frown on my defects<sep>when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum<sep>called to that audit by advised respects<sep>against that time when thou shalt strangely pass<sep>and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye<sep>when love converted from the thing it was<sep>shall reasons find of settled gravity<sep>against that time do i ensconce me here<sep>within the knowledge of mine own desert<sep>and this my hand against my self uprear<sep>to guard the lawful reasons on thy part<sep>to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws<sep>since why to love i can allege no cause<sep>~<sep>how heavy do i journey on the way<sep>when what i seek my weary travels end<sep>doth teach that case and that repose to say<sep>thus far the miles are measured from thy friend<sep>the beast that bears me tired with my woe<sep>plods dully on to bear that weight in me<sep>as if by some instinct the wretch did know<sep>his rider loved not speed being made from thee<sep>the bloody spur cannot provoke him on<sep>that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide<sep>which heavily he answers with a groan<sep>more sharp to me than spurring to his side<sep>for that same groan doth put this in my mind<sep>my grief lies onward and my joy behind<sep>~<sep>thus can my love excuse the slow offence<sep>of my dull bearer when from thee i speed<sep>from where thou art why should i haste me thence<sep>till i return of posting is no need<sep>o what excuse will my poor beast then find<sep>when swift extremity can seem but slow<sep>then should i spur though mounted on the wind<sep>in winged speed no motion shall i know<sep>then can no horse with my desire keep pace<sep>therefore desire of perfectst love being made<sep>shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race<sep>but love for love thus shall excuse my jade<sep>since from thee going he went wilfulslow<sep>towards thee ill run and give him leave to go<sep>~<sep>so am i as the rich whose blessed key<sep>can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure<sep>the which he will not every hour survey<sep>for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure<sep>therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare<sep>since seldom coming in that long year set<sep>like stones of worth they thinly placed are<sep>or captain jewels in the carcanet<sep>so is the time that keeps you as my chest<sep>or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide<sep>to make some special instant specialblest<sep>by new unfolding his imprisoned pride<sep>blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope<sep>being had to triumph being lacked to hope<sep>~<sep>what is your substance whereof are you made<sep>that millions of strange shadows on you tend<sep>since every one hath every one one shade<sep>and you but one can every shadow lend<sep>describe adonis and the counterfeit<sep>is poorly imitated after you<sep>on helens cheek all art of beauty set<sep>and you in grecian tires are painted new<sep>speak of the spring and foison of the year<sep>the one doth shadow of your beauty show<sep>the other as your bounty doth appear<sep>and you in every blessed shape we know<sep>in all external grace you have some part<sep>but you like none none you for constant heart<sep>~<sep>o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem<sep>by that sweet ornament which truth doth give<sep>the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem<sep>for that sweet odour which doth in it live<sep>the canker blooms have full as deep a dye<sep>as the perfumed tincture of the roses<sep>hang on such thorns and play as wantonly<sep>when summers breath their masked buds discloses<sep>but for their virtue only is their show<sep>they live unwooed and unrespected fade<sep>die to themselves sweet roses do not so<sep>of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made<sep>and so of you beauteous and lovely youth<sep>when that shall fade my verse distills your truth<sep>~<sep>not marble nor the gilded monuments<sep>of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme<sep>but you shall shine more bright in these contents<sep>than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time<sep>when wasteful war shall statues overturn<sep>and broils root out the work of masonry<sep>nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn<sep>the living record of your memory<sep>gainst death and alloblivious enmity<sep>shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room<sep>even in the eyes of all posterity<sep>that wear this world out to the ending doom<sep>so till the judgment that your self arise<sep>you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes<sep>~<sep>sweet love renew thy force be it not said<sep>thy edge should blunter be than appetite<sep>which but today by feeding is allayed<sep>tomorrow sharpened in his former might<sep>so love be thou although today thou fill<sep>thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness<sep>tomorrow see again and do not kill<sep>the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness<sep>let this sad interim like the ocean be<sep>which parts the shore where two contracted new<sep>come daily to the banks that when they see<sep>return of love more blest may be the view<sep>or call it winter which being full of care<sep>makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare<sep>~<sep>being your slave what should i do but tend<sep>upon the hours and times of your desire<sep>i have no precious time at all to spend<sep>nor services to do till you require<sep>nor dare i chide the worldwithoutend hour<sep>whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you<sep>nor think the bitterness of absence sour<sep>when you have bid your servant once adieu<sep>nor dare i question with my jealous thought<sep>where you may be or your affairs suppose<sep>but like a sad slave stay and think of nought<sep>save where you are how happy you make those<sep>so true a fool is love that in your will<sep>though you do any thing he thinks no ill<sep>~<sep>that god forbid that made me first your slave<sep>i should in thought control your times of pleasure<sep>or at your hand th account of hours to crave<sep>being your vassal bound to stay your leisure<sep>o let me suffer being at your beck<sep>th imprisoned absence of your liberty<sep>and patience tame to sufferance bide each check<sep>without accusing you of injury<sep>be where you list your charter is so strong<sep>that you your self may privilage your time<sep>to what you will to you it doth belong<sep>your self to pardon of selfdoing crime<sep>i am to wait though waiting so be hell<sep>not blame your pleasure be it ill or well<sep>~<sep>if there be nothing new but that which is<sep>hath been before how are our brains beguiled<sep>which labouring for invention bear amis<sep>the second burthen of a former child<sep>o that record could with a backward look<sep>even of five hundred courses of the sun<sep>show me your image in some antique book<sep>since mind at first in character was done<sep>that i might see what the old world could say<sep>to this composed wonder of your frame<sep>whether we are mended or whether better they<sep>or whether revolution be the same<sep>o sure i am the wits of former days<sep>to subjects worse have given admiring praise<sep>~<sep>like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore<sep>so do our minutes hasten to their end<sep>each changing place with that which goes before<sep>in sequent toil all forwards do contend<sep>nativity once in the main of light<sep>crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned<sep>crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight<sep>and time that gave doth now his gift confound<sep>time doth transfix the flourish set on youth<sep>and delves the parallels in beautys brow<sep>feeds on the rarities of natures truth<sep>and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow<sep>and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand<sep>praising thy worth despite his cruel hand<sep>~<sep>is it thy will thy image should keep open<sep>my heavy eyelids to the weary night<sep>dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken<sep>while shadows like to thee do mock my sight<sep>is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee<sep>so far from home into my deeds to pry<sep>to find out shames and idle hours in me<sep>the scope and tenure of thy jealousy<sep>o no thy love though much is not so great<sep>it is my love that keeps mine eye awake<sep>mine own true love that doth my rest defeat<sep>to play the watchman ever for thy sake<sep>for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere<sep>from me far off with others all too near<sep>~<sep>sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye<sep>and all my soul and all my every part<sep>and for this sin there is no remedy<sep>it is so grounded inward in my heart<sep>methinks no face so gracious is as mine<sep>no shape so true no truth of such account<sep>and for my self mine own worth do define<sep>as i all other in all worths surmount<sep>but when my glass shows me my self indeed<sep>beated and chopt with tanned antiquity<sep>mine own selflove quite contrary i read<sep>self so selfloving were iniquity<sep>tis thee my self that for my self i praise<sep>painting my age with beauty of thy days<sep>~<sep>against my love shall be as i am now<sep>with times injurious hand crushed and oerworn<sep>when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow<sep>with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn<sep>hath travelled on to ages steepy night<sep>and all those beauties whereof now hes king<sep>are vanishing or vanished out of sight<sep>stealing away the treasure of his spring<sep>for such a time do i now fortify<sep>against confounding ages cruel knife<sep>that he shall never cut from memory<sep>my sweet loves beauty though my lovers life<sep>his beauty shall in these black lines be seen<sep>and they shall live and he in them still green<sep>~<sep>when i have seen by times fell hand defaced<sep>the richproud cost of outworn buried age<sep>when sometime lofty towers i see downrased<sep>and brass eternal slave to mortal rage<sep>when i have seen the hungry ocean gain<sep>advantage on the kingdom of the shore<sep>and the firm soil win of the watery main<sep>increasing store with loss and loss with store<sep>when i have seen such interchange of state<sep>or state it self confounded to decay<sep>ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate<sep>that time will come and take my love away<sep>this thought is as a death which cannot choose<sep>but weep to have that which it fears to lose<sep>~<sep>since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea<sep>but sad mortality oersways their power<sep>how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea<sep>whose action is no stronger than a flower<sep>o how shall summers honey breath hold out<sep>against the wrackful siege of battring days<sep>when rocks impregnable are not so stout<sep>nor gates of steel so strong but time decays<sep>o fearful meditation where alack<sep>shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid<sep>or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back<sep>or who his spoil of beauty can forbid<sep>o none unless this miracle have might<sep>that in black ink my love may still shine bright<sep>~<sep>tired with all these for restful death i cry<sep>as to behold desert a beggar born<sep>and needy nothing trimmed in jollity<sep>and purest faith unhappily forsworn<sep>and gilded honour shamefully misplaced<sep>and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted<sep>and right perfection wrongfully disgraced<sep>and strength by limping sway disabled<sep>and art made tonguetied by authority<sep>and folly doctorlike controlling skill<sep>and simple truth miscalled simplicity<sep>and captive good attending captain ill<sep>tired with all these from these would i be gone<sep>save that to die i leave my love alone<sep>~<sep>ah wherefore with infection should he live<sep>and with his presence grace impiety<sep>that sin by him advantage should achieve<sep>and lace it self with his society<sep>why should false painting imitate his cheek<sep>and steal dead seeming of his living hue<sep>why should poor beauty indirectly seek<sep>roses of shadow since his rose is true<sep>why should he live now nature bankrupt is<sep>beggared of blood to blush through lively veins<sep>for she hath no exchequer now but his<sep>and proud of many lives upon his gains<sep>o him she stores to show what wealth she had<sep>in days long since before these last so bad<sep>~<sep>thus is his cheek the map of days outworn<sep>when beauty lived and died as flowers do now<sep>before these bastard signs of fair were born<sep>or durst inhabit on a living brow<sep>before the golden tresses of the dead<sep>the right of sepulchres were shorn away<sep>to live a second life on second head<sep>ere beautys dead fleece made another gay<sep>in him those holy antique hours are seen<sep>without all ornament it self and true<sep>making no summer of anothers green<sep>robbing no old to dress his beauty new<sep>and him as for a map doth nature store<sep>to show false art what beauty was of yore<sep>~<sep>those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view<sep>want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend<sep>all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due<sep>uttering bare truth even so as foes commend<sep>thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned<sep>but those same tongues that give thee so thine own<sep>in other accents do this praise confound<sep>by seeing farther than the eye hath shown<sep>they look into the beauty of thy mind<sep>and that in guess they measure by thy deeds<sep>then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind<sep>to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds<sep>but why thy odour matcheth not thy show<sep>the soil is this that thou dost common grow<sep>~<sep>that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect<sep>for slanders mark was ever yet the fair<sep>the ornament of beauty is suspect<sep>a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air<sep>so thou be good slander doth but approve<sep>thy worth the greater being wooed of time<sep>for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love<sep>and thou presentst a pure unstained prime<sep>thou hast passed by the ambush of young days<sep>either not assailed or victor being charged<sep>yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise<sep>to tie up envy evermore enlarged<sep>if some suspect of ill masked not thy show<sep>then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe<sep>~<sep>no longer mourn for me when i am dead<sep>than you shall hear the surly sullen bell<sep>give warning to the world that i am fled<sep>from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell<sep>nay if you read this line remember not<sep>the hand that writ it for i love you so<sep>that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot<sep>if thinking on me then should make you woe<sep>o if i say you look upon this verse<sep>when i perhaps compounded am with clay<sep>do not so much as my poor name rehearse<sep>but let your love even with my life decay<sep>lest the wise world should look into your moan<sep>and mock you with me after i am gone<sep>~<sep>o lest the world should task you to recite<sep>what merit lived in me that you should love<sep>after my death dear love forget me quite<sep>for you in me can nothing worthy prove<sep>unless you would devise some virtuous lie<sep>to do more for me than mine own desert<sep>and hang more praise upon deceased i<sep>than niggard truth would willingly impart<sep>o lest your true love may seem false in this<sep>that you for love speak well of me untrue<sep>my name be buried where my body is<sep>and live no more to shame nor me nor you<sep>for i am shamed by that which i bring forth<sep>and so should you to love things nothing worth<sep>~<sep>that time of year thou mayst in me behold<sep>when yellow leaves or none or few do hang<sep>upon those boughs which shake against the cold<sep>bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang<sep>in me thou seest the twilight of such day<sep>as after sunset fadeth in the west<sep>which by and by black night doth take away<sep>deaths second self that seals up all in rest<sep>in me thou seest the glowing of such fire<sep>that on the ashes of his youth doth lie<sep>as the deathbed whereon it must expire<sep>consumed with that which it was nourished by<sep>this thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong<sep>to love that well which thou must leave ere long<sep>~<sep>but be contented when that fell arrest<sep>without all bail shall carry me away<sep>my life hath in this line some interest<sep>which for memorial still with thee shall stay<sep>when thou reviewest this thou dost review<sep>the very part was consecrate to thee<sep>the earth can have but earth which is his due<sep>my spirit is thine the better part of me<sep>so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life<sep>the prey of worms my body being dead<sep>the coward conquest of a wretchs knife<sep>too base of thee to be remembered<sep>the worth of that is that which it contains<sep>and that is this and this with thee remains<sep>~<sep>so are you to my thoughts as food to life<sep>or as sweetseasoned showers are to the ground<sep>and for the peace of you i hold such strife<sep>as twixt a miser and his wealth is found<sep>now proud as an enjoyer and anon<sep>doubting the filching age will steal his treasure<sep>now counting best to be with you alone<sep>then bettered that the world may see my pleasure<sep>sometime all full with feasting on your sight<sep>and by and by clean starved for a look<sep>possessing or pursuing no delight<sep>save what is had or must from you be took<sep>thus do i pine and surfeit day by day<sep>or gluttoning on all or all away<sep>~<sep>why is my verse so barren of new pride<sep>so far from variation or quick change<sep>why with the time do i not glance aside<sep>to newfound methods and to compounds strange<sep>why write i still all one ever the same<sep>and keep invention in a noted weed<sep>that every word doth almost tell my name<sep>showing their birth and where they did proceed<sep>o know sweet love i always write of you<sep>and you and love are still my argument<sep>so all my best is dressing old words new<sep>spending again what is already spent<sep>for as the sun is daily new and old<sep>so is my love still telling what is told<sep>~<sep>thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear<sep>thy dial how thy precious minutes waste<sep>these vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear<sep>and of this book this learning mayst thou taste<sep>the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show<sep>of mouthed graves will give thee memory<sep>thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know<sep>times thievish progress to eternity<sep>look what thy memory cannot contain<sep>commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find<sep>those children nursed delivered from thy brain<sep>to take a new acquaintance of thy mind<sep>these offices so oft as thou wilt look<sep>shall profit thee and much enrich thy book<sep>~<sep>so oft have i invoked thee for my muse<sep>and found such fair assistance in my verse<sep>as every alien pen hath got my use<sep>and under thee their poesy disperse<sep>thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing<sep>and heavy ignorance aloft to fly<sep>have added feathers to the learneds wing<sep>and given grace a double majesty<sep>yet be most proud of that which i compile<sep>whose influence is thine and born of thee<sep>in others works thou dost but mend the style<sep>and arts with thy sweet graces graced be<sep>but thou art all my art and dost advance<sep>as high as learning my rude ignorance<sep>~<sep>whilst i alone did call upon thy aid<sep>my verse alone had all thy gentle grace<sep>but now my gracious numbers are decayed<sep>and my sick muse doth give an other place<sep>i grant sweet love thy lovely argument<sep>deserves the travail of a worthier pen<sep>yet what of thee thy poet doth invent<sep>he robs thee of and pays it thee again<sep>he lends thee virtue and he stole that word<sep>from thy behaviour beauty doth he give<sep>and found it in thy cheek he can afford<sep>no praise to thee but what in thee doth live<sep>then thank him not for that which he doth say<sep>since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay<sep>~<sep>o how i faint when i of you do write<sep>knowing a better spirit doth use your name<sep>and in the praise thereof spends all his might<sep>to make me tonguetied speaking of your fame<sep>but since your worth wide as the ocean is<sep>the humble as the proudest sail doth bear<sep>my saucy bark inferior far to his<sep>on your broad main doth wilfully appear<sep>your shallowest help will hold me up afloat<sep>whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride<sep>or being wrecked i am a worthless boat<sep>he of tall building and of goodly pride<sep>then if he thrive and i be cast away<sep>the worst was this my love was my decay<sep>~<sep>or i shall live your epitaph to make<sep>or you survive when i in earth am rotten<sep>from hence your memory death cannot take<sep>although in me each part will be forgotten<sep>your name from hence immortal life shall have<sep>though i once gone to all the world must die<sep>the earth can yield me but a common grave<sep>when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie<sep>your monument shall be my gentle verse<sep>which eyes not yet created shall oerread<sep>and tongues to be your being shall rehearse<sep>when all the breathers of this world are dead<sep>you still shall live such virtue hath my pen<sep>where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men<sep>~<sep>i grant thou wert not married to my muse<sep>and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook<sep>the dedicated words which writers use<sep>of their fair subject blessing every book<sep>thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue<sep>finding thy worth a limit past my praise<sep>and therefore art enforced to seek anew<sep>some fresher stamp of the timebettering days<sep>and do so love yet when they have devised<sep>what strained touches rhetoric can lend<sep>thou truly fair wert truly sympathized<sep>in true plain words by thy truetelling friend<sep>and their gross painting might be better used<sep>where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused<sep>~<sep>i never saw that you did painting need<sep>and therefore to your fair no painting set<sep>i found or thought i found you did exceed<sep>that barren tender of a poets debt<sep>and therefore have i slept in your report<sep>that you your self being extant well might show<sep>how far a modern quill doth come too short<sep>speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow<sep>this silence for my sin you did impute<sep>which shall be most my glory being dumb<sep>for i impair not beauty being mute<sep>when others would give life and bring a tomb<sep>there lives more life in one of your fair eyes<sep>than both your poets can in praise devise<sep>~<sep>who is it that says most which can say more<sep>than this rich praise that you alone are you<sep>in whose confine immured is the store<sep>which should example where your equal grew<sep>lean penury within that pen doth dwell<sep>that to his subject lends not some small glory<sep>but he that writes of you if he can tell<sep>that you are you so dignifies his story<sep>let him but copy what in you is writ<sep>not making worse what nature made so clear<sep>and such a counterpart shall fame his wit<sep>making his style admired every where<sep>you to your beauteous blessings add a curse<sep>being fond on praise which makes your praises worse<sep>~<sep>my tonguetied muse in manners holds her still<sep>while comments of your praise richly compiled<sep>reserve their character with golden quill<sep>and precious phrase by all the muses filed<sep>i think good thoughts whilst other write good words<sep>and like unlettered clerk still cry amen<sep>to every hymn that able spirit affords<sep>in polished form of well refined pen<sep>hearing you praised i say tis so tis true<sep>and to the most of praise add something more<sep>but that is in my thought whose love to you<sep>though words come hindmost holds his rank before<sep>then others for the breath of words respect<sep>me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect<sep>~<sep>was it the proud full sail of his great verse<sep>bound for the prize of all too precious you<sep>that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse<sep>making their tomb the womb wherein they grew<sep>was it his spirit by spirits taught to write<sep>above a mortal pitch that struck me dead<sep>no neither he nor his compeers by night<sep>giving him aid my verse astonished<sep>he nor that affable familiar ghost<sep>which nightly gulls him with intelligence<sep>as victors of my silence cannot boast<sep>i was not sick of any fear from thence<sep>but when your countenance filled up his line<sep>then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine<sep>~<sep>farewell thou art too dear for my possessing<sep>and like enough thou knowst thy estimate<sep>the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing<sep>my bonds in thee are all determinate<sep>for how do i hold thee but by thy granting<sep>and for that riches where is my deserving<sep>the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting<sep>and so my patent back again is swerving<sep>thy self thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing<sep>or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking<sep>so thy great gift upon misprision growing<sep>comes home again on better judgement making<sep>thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter<sep>in sleep a king but waking no such matter<sep>~<sep>when thou shalt be disposed to set me light<sep>and place my merit in the eye of scorn<sep>upon thy side against my self ill fight<sep>and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn<sep>with mine own weakness being best acquainted<sep>upon thy part i can set down a story<sep>of faults concealed wherein i am attainted<sep>that thou in losing me shalt win much glory<sep>and i by this will be a gainer too<sep>for bending all my loving thoughts on thee<sep>the injuries that to my self i do<sep>doing thee vantage doublevantage me<sep>such is my love to thee i so belong<sep>that for thy right my self will bear all wrong<sep>~<sep>say that thou didst forsake me for some fault<sep>and i will comment upon that offence<sep>speak of my lameness and i straight will halt<sep>against thy reasons making no defence<sep>thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill<sep>to set a form upon desired change<sep>as ill my self disgrace knowing thy will<sep>i will acquaintance strangle and look strange<sep>be absent from thy walks and in my tongue<sep>thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell<sep>lest i too much profane should do it wronk<sep>and haply of our old acquaintance tell<sep>for thee against my self ill vow debate<sep>for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate<sep>~<sep>then hate me when thou wilt if ever now<sep>now while the world is bent my deeds to cross<sep>join with the spite of fortune make me bow<sep>and do not drop in for an afterloss<sep>ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow<sep>come in the rearward of a conquered woe<sep>give not a windy night a rainy morrow<sep>to linger out a purposed overthrow<sep>if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last<sep>when other petty griefs have done their spite<sep>but in the onset come so shall i taste<sep>at first the very worst of fortunes might<sep>and other strains of woe which now seem woe<sep>compared with loss of thee will not seem so<sep>~<sep>some glory in their birth some in their skill<sep>some in their wealth some in their bodys force<sep>some in their garments though newfangled ill<sep>some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse<sep>and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure<sep>wherein it finds a joy above the rest<sep>but these particulars are not my measure<sep>all these i better in one general best<sep>thy love is better than high birth to me<sep>richer than wealth prouder than garments costs<sep>of more delight than hawks and horses be<sep>and having thee of all mens pride i boast<sep>wretched in this alone that thou mayst take<sep>all this away and me most wretched make<sep>~<sep>but do thy worst to steal thy self away<sep>for term of life thou art assured mine<sep>and life no longer than thy love will stay<sep>for it depends upon that love of thine<sep>then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs<sep>when in the least of them my life hath end<sep>i see a better state to me belongs<sep>than that which on thy humour doth depend<sep>thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind<sep>since that my life on thy revolt doth lie<sep>o what a happy title do i find<sep>happy to have thy love happy to die<sep>but whats so blessedfair that fears no blot<sep>thou mayst be false and yet i know it not<sep>~<sep>so shall i live supposing thou art true<sep>like a deceived husband so loves face<sep>may still seem love to me though altered new<sep>thy looks with me thy heart in other place<sep>for there can live no hatred in thine eye<sep>therefore in that i cannot know thy change<sep>in manys looks the false hearts history<sep>is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange<sep>but heaven in thy creation did decree<sep>that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell<sep>whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be<sep>thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell<sep>how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow<sep>if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show<sep>~<sep>they that have power to hurt and will do none<sep>that do not do the thing they most do show<sep>who moving others are themselves as stone<sep>unmoved cold and to temptation slow<sep>they rightly do inherit heavens graces<sep>and husband natures riches from expense<sep>tibey are the lords and owners of their faces<sep>others but stewards of their excellence<sep>the summers flower is to the summer sweet<sep>though to it self it only live and die<sep>but if that flower with base infection meet<sep>the basest weed outbraves his dignity<sep>for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds<sep>lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds<sep>~<sep>how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame<sep>which like a canker in the fragrant rose<sep>doth spot the beauty of thy budding name<sep>o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose<sep>that tongue that tells the story of thy days<sep>making lascivious comments on thy sport<sep>cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise<sep>naming thy name blesses an ill report<sep>o what a mansion have those vices got<sep>which for their habitation chose out thee<sep>where beautys veil doth cover every blot<sep>and all things turns to fair that eyes can see<sep>take heed dear heart of this large privilege<sep>the hardest knife illused doth lose his edge<sep>~<sep>some say thy fault is youth some wantonness<sep>some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport<sep>both grace and faults are loved of more and less<sep>thou makst faults graces that to thee resort<sep>as on the finger of a throned queen<sep>the basest jewel will be well esteemed<sep>so are those errors that in thee are seen<sep>to truths translated and for true things deemed<sep>how many lambs might the stern wolf betray<sep>if like a lamb he could his looks translate<sep>how many gazers mightst thou lead away<sep>if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state<sep>but do not so i love thee in such sort<sep>as thou being mine mine is thy good report<sep>~<sep>how like a winter hath my absence been<sep>from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year<sep>what freezings have i felt what dark days seen<sep>what old decembers bareness everywhere<sep>and yet this time removed was summers time<sep>the teeming autumn big with rich increase<sep>bearing the wanton burden of the prime<sep>like widowed wombs after their lords decease<sep>yet this abundant issue seemed to me<sep>but hope of orphans and unfathered fruit<sep>for summer and his pleasures wait on thee<sep>and thou away the very birds are mute<sep>or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer<sep>that leaves look pale dreading the winters near<sep>~<sep>from you have i been absent in the spring<sep>when proudpied april dressed in all his trim<sep>hath put a spirit of youth in every thing<sep>that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him<sep>yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell<sep>of different flowers in odour and in hue<sep>could make me any summers story tell<sep>or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew<sep>nor did i wonder at the lilys white<sep>nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose<sep>they were but sweet but figures of delight<sep>drawn after you you pattern of all those<sep>yet seemed it winter still and you away<sep>as with your shadow i with these did play<sep>~<sep>the forward violet thus did i chide<sep>sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells<sep>if not from my loves breath the purple pride<sep>which on thy soft check for complexion dwells<sep>in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed<sep>the lily i condemned for thy hand<sep>and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair<sep>the roses fearfully on thorns did stand<sep>one blushing shame another white despair<sep>a third nor red nor white had stoln of both<sep>and to his robbery had annexed thy breath<sep>but for his theft in pride of all his growth<sep>a vengeful canker eat him up to death<sep>more flowers i noted yet i none could see<sep>but sweet or colour it had stoln from thee<sep>~<sep>where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long<sep>to speak of that which gives thee all thy might<sep>spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song<sep>darkening thy power to lend base subjects light<sep>return forgetful muse and straight redeem<sep>in gentle numbers time so idly spent<sep>sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem<sep>and gives thy pen both skill and argument<sep>rise resty muse my loves sweet face survey<sep>if time have any wrinkle graven there<sep>if any be a satire to decay<sep>and make times spoils despised everywhere<sep>give my love fame faster than time wastes life<sep>so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife<sep>~<sep>o truant muse what shall be thy amends<sep>for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed<sep>both truth and beauty on my love depends<sep>so dost thou too and therein dignified<sep>make answer muse wilt thou not haply say<sep>truth needs no colour with his colour fixed<sep>beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay<sep>but best is best if never intermixed<sep>because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb<sep>excuse not silence so fort lies in thee<sep>to make him much outlive a gilded tomb<sep>and to be praised of ages yet to be<sep>then do thy office muse i teach thee how<sep>to make him seem long hence as he shows now<sep>~<sep>my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming<sep>i love not less though less the show appear<sep>that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming<sep>the owners tongue doth publish every where<sep>our love was new and then but in the spring<sep>when i was wont to greet it with my lays<sep>as philomel in summers front doth sing<sep>and stops her pipe in growth of riper days<sep>not that the summer is less pleasant now<sep>than when her mournful hymns did hush the night<sep>but that wild music burthens every bough<sep>and sweets grown common lose their dear delight<sep>therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue<sep>because i would not dull you with my song<sep>~<sep>alack what poverty my muse brings forth<sep>that having such a scope to show her pride<sep>the argument all bare is of more worth<sep>than when it hath my added praise beside<sep>o blame me not if i no more can write<sep>look in your glass and there appears a face<sep>that overgoes my blunt invention quite<sep>dulling my lines and doing me disgrace<sep>were it not sinful then striving to mend<sep>to mar the subject that before was well<sep>for to no other pass my verses tend<sep>than of your graces and your gifts to tell<sep>and more much more than in my verse can sit<sep>your own glass shows you when you look in it<sep>~<sep>to me fair friend you never can be old<sep>for as you were when first your eye i eyed<sep>such seems your beauty still three winters cold<sep>have from the forests shook three summers pride<sep>three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned<sep>in process of the seasons have i seen<sep>three april perfumes in three hot junes burned<sep>since first i saw you fresh which yet are green<sep>ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand<sep>steal from his figure and no pace perceived<sep>so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand<sep>hath motion and mine eye may be deceived<sep>for fear of which hear this thou age unbred<sep>ere you were born was beautys summer dead<sep>~<sep>let not my love be called idolatry<sep>nor my beloved as an idol show<sep>since all alike my songs and praises be<sep>to one of one still such and ever so<sep>kind is my love today tomorrow kind<sep>still constant in a wondrous excellence<sep>therefore my verse to constancy confined<sep>one thing expressing leaves out difference<sep>fair kind and true is all my argument<sep>fair kind and true varying to other words<sep>and in this change is my invention spent<sep>three themes in one which wondrous scope affords<sep>fair kind and true have often lived alone<sep>which three till now never kept seat in one<sep>~<sep>when in the chronicle of wasted time<sep>i see descriptions of the fairest wights<sep>and beauty making beautiful old rhyme<sep>in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights<sep>then in the blazon of sweet beautys best<sep>of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow<sep>i see their antique pen would have expressed<sep>even such a beauty as you master now<sep>so all their praises are but prophecies<sep>of this our time all you prefiguring<sep>and for they looked but with divining eyes<sep>they had not skill enough your worth to sing<sep>for we which now behold these present days<sep>have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise<sep>~<sep>not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul<sep>of the wide world dreaming on things to come<sep>can yet the lease of my true love control<sep>supposed as forfeit to a confined doom<sep>the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured<sep>and the sad augurs mock their own presage<sep>incertainties now crown themselves assured<sep>and peace proclaims olives of endless age<sep>now with the drops of this most balmy time<sep>my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes<sep>since spite of him ill live in this poor rhyme<sep>while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes<sep>and thou in this shalt find thy monument<sep>when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent<sep>~<sep>whats in the brain that ink may character<sep>which hath not figured to thee my true spirit<sep>whats new to speak what now to register<sep>that may express my love or thy dear merit<sep>nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine<sep>i must each day say oer the very same<sep>counting no old thing old thou mine i thine<sep>even as when first i hallowed thy fair name<sep>so that eternal love in loves fresh case<sep>weighs not the dust and injury of age<sep>nor gives to necessary wrinkles place<sep>but makes antiquity for aye his page<sep>finding the first conceit of love there bred<sep>where time and outward form would show it dead<sep>~<sep>o never say that i was false of heart<sep>though absence seemed my flame to qualify<sep>as easy might i from my self depart<sep>as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie<sep>that is my home of love if i have ranged<sep>like him that travels i return again<sep>just to the time not with the time exchanged<sep>so that my self bring water for my stain<sep>never believe though in my nature reigned<sep>all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood<sep>that it could so preposterously be stained<sep>to leave for nothing all thy sum of good<sep>for nothing this wide universe i call<sep>save thou my rose in it thou art my all<sep>~<sep>alas tis true i have gone here and there<sep>and made my self a motley to the view<sep>gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear<sep>made old offences of affections new<sep>most true it is that i have looked on truth<sep>askance and strangely but by all above<sep>these blenches gave my heart another youth<sep>and worse essays proved thee my best of love<sep>now all is done have what shall have no end<sep>mine appetite i never more will grind<sep>on newer proof to try an older friend<sep>a god in love to whom i am confined<sep>then give me welcome next my heaven the best<sep>even to thy pure and most most loving breast<sep>~<sep>o for my sake do you with fortune chide<sep>the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds<sep>that did not better for my life provide<sep>than public means which public manners breeds<sep>thence comes it that my name receives a brand<sep>and almost thence my nature is subdued<sep>to what it works in like the dyers hand<sep>pity me then and wish i were renewed<sep>whilst like a willing patient i will drink<sep>potions of eisel gainst my strong infection<sep>no bitterness that i will bitter think<sep>nor double penance to correct correction<sep>pity me then dear friend and i assure ye<sep>even that your pity is enough to cure me<sep>~<sep>your love and pity doth th impression fill<sep>which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow<sep>for what care i who calls me well or ill<sep>so you oergreen my bad my good allow<sep>you are my all the world and i must strive<sep>to know my shames and praises from your tongue<sep>none else to me nor i to none alive<sep>that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong<sep>in so profound abysm i throw all care<sep>of others voices that my adders sense<sep>to critic and to flatterer stopped are<sep>mark how with my neglect i do dispense<sep>you are so strongly in my purpose bred<sep>that all the world besides methinks are dead<sep>~<sep>since i left you mine eye is in my mind<sep>and that which governs me to go about<sep>doth part his function and is partly blind<sep>seems seeing but effectually is out<sep>for it no form delivers to the heart<sep>of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch<sep>of his quick objects hath the mind no part<sep>nor his own vision holds what it doth catch<sep>for if it see the rudst or gentlest sight<sep>the most sweet favour or deformedst creature<sep>the mountain or the sea the day or night<sep>the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature<sep>incapable of more replete with you<sep>my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue<sep>~<sep>or whether doth my mind being crowned with you<sep>drink up the monarchs plague this flattery<sep>or whether shall i say mine eye saith true<sep>and that your love taught it this alchemy<sep>to make of monsters and things indigest<sep>such cherubins as your sweet self resemble<sep>creating every bad a perfect best<sep>as fast as objects to his beams assemble<sep>o tis the first tis flattery in my seeing<sep>and my great mind most kingly drinks it up<sep>mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing<sep>and to his palate doth prepare the cup<sep>if it be poisoned tis the lesser sin<sep>that mine eye loves it and doth first begin<sep>~<sep>those lines that i before have writ do lie<sep>even those that said i could not love you dearer<sep>yet then my judgment knew no reason why<sep>my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer<sep>but reckoning time whose millioned accidents<sep>creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings<sep>tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents<sep>divert strong minds to the course of altring things<sep>alas why fearing of times tyranny<sep>might i not then say now i love you best<sep>when i was certain oer incertainty<sep>crowning the present doubting of the rest<sep>love is a babe then might i not say so<sep>to give full growth to that which still doth grow<sep>~<sep>let me not to the marriage of true minds<sep>admit impediments love is not love<sep>which alters when it alteration finds<sep>or bends with the remover to remove<sep>o no it is an everfixed mark<sep>that looks on tempests and is never shaken<sep>it is the star to every wandring bark<sep>whose worths unknown although his height be taken<sep>loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks<sep>within his bending sickles compass come<sep>love alters not with his brief hours and weeks<sep>but bears it out even to the edge of doom<sep>if this be error and upon me proved<sep>i never writ nor no man ever loved<sep>~<sep>accuse me thus that i have scanted all<sep>wherein i should your great deserts repay<sep>forgot upon your dearest love to call<sep>whereto all bonds do tie me day by day<sep>that i have frequent been with unknown minds<sep>and given to time your own dearpurchased right<sep>that i have hoisted sail to all the winds<sep>which should transport me farthest from your sight<sep>book both my wilfulness and errors down<sep>and on just proof surmise accumulate<sep>bring me within the level of your frown<sep>but shoot not at me in your wakened hate<sep>since my appeal says i did strive to prove<sep>the constancy and virtue of your love<sep>~<sep>like as to make our appetite more keen<sep>with eager compounds we our palate urge<sep>as to prevent our maladies unseen<sep>we sicken to shun sickness when we purge<sep>even so being full of your neercloying sweetness<sep>to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding<sep>and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness<sep>to be diseased ere that there was true needing<sep>thus policy in love t anticipate<sep>the ills that were not grew to faults assured<sep>and brought to medicine a healthful state<sep>which rank of goodness would by ill be cured<sep>but thence i learn and find the lesson true<sep>drugs poison him that so feil sick of you<sep>~<sep>what potions have i drunk of siren tears<sep>distilled from limbecks foul as hell within<sep>applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears<sep>still losing when i saw my self to win<sep>what wretched errors hath my heart committed<sep>whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never<sep>how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted<sep>in the distraction of this madding fever<sep>o benefit of ill now i find true<sep>that better is by evil still made better<sep>and ruined love when it is built anew<sep>grows fairer than at first more strong far greater<sep>so i return rebuked to my content<sep>and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent<sep>~<sep>that you were once unkind befriends me now<sep>and for that sorrow which i then did feel<sep>needs must i under my transgression bow<sep>unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel<sep>for if you were by my unkindness shaken<sep>as i by yours yhave passed a hell of time<sep>and i a tyrant have no leisure taken<sep>to weigh how once i suffered in your crime<sep>o that our night of woe might have remembered<sep>my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits<sep>and soon to you as you to me then tendered<sep>the humble salve which wounded bosoms fits<sep>but that your trespass now becomes a fee<sep>mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me<sep>~<sep>tis better to be vile than vile esteemed<sep>when not to be receives reproach of being<sep>and the just pleasure lost which is so deemed<sep>not by our feeling but by others seeing<sep>for why should others false adulterate eyes<sep>give salutation to my sportive blood<sep>or on my frailties why are frailer spies<sep>which in their wills count bad what i think good<sep>no i am that i am and they that level<sep>at my abuses reckon up their own<sep>i may be straight though they themselves be bevel<sep>by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown<sep>unless this general evil they maintain<sep>all men are bad and in their badness reign<sep>~<sep>thy gift thy tables are within my brain<sep>full charactered with lasting memory<sep>which shall above that idle rank remain<sep>beyond all date even to eternity<sep>or at the least so long as brain and heart<sep>have faculty by nature to subsist<sep>till each to razed oblivion yield his part<sep>of thee thy record never can be missed<sep>that poor retention could not so much hold<sep>nor need i tallies thy dear love to score<sep>therefore to give them from me was i bold<sep>to trust those tables that receive thee more<sep>to keep an adjunct to remember thee<sep>were to import forgetfulness in me<sep>~<sep>no time thou shalt not boast that i do change<sep>thy pyramids built up with newer might<sep>to me are nothing novel nothing strange<sep>they are but dressings of a former sight<sep>our dates are brief and therefore we admire<sep>what thou dost foist upon us that is old<sep>and rather make them born to our desire<sep>than think that we before have heard them told<sep>thy registers and thee i both defy<sep>not wondring at the present nor the past<sep>for thy records and what we see doth lie<sep>made more or less by thy continual haste<sep>this i do vow and this shall ever be<sep>i will be true despite thy scythe and thee<sep>~<sep>if my dear love were but the child of state<sep>it might for fortunes bastard be unfathered<sep>as subject to times love or to times hate<sep>weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered<sep>no it was builded far from accident<sep>it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls<sep>under the blow of thralled discontent<sep>whereto th inviting time our fashion calls<sep>it fears not policy that heretic<sep>which works on leases of shortnumbered hours<sep>but all alone stands hugely politic<sep>that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers<sep>to this i witness call the fools of time<sep>which die for goodness who have lived for crime<sep>~<sep>weret aught to me i bore the canopy<sep>with my extern the outward honouring<sep>or laid great bases for eternity<sep>which proves more short than waste or ruining<sep>have i not seen dwellers on form and favour<sep>lose all and more by paying too much rent<sep>for compound sweet forgoing simple savour<sep>pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent<sep>no let me be obsequious in thy heart<sep>and take thou my oblation poor but free<sep>which is not mixed with seconds knows no art<sep>but mutual render only me for thee<sep>hence thou suborned informer a true soul<sep>when most impeached stands least in thy control<sep>~<sep>o thou my lovely boy who in thy power<sep>dost hold times fickle glass his fickle hour<sep>who hast by waning grown and therein showst<sep>thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst<sep>if nature sovereign mistress over wrack<sep>as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back<sep>she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill<sep>may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill<sep>yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure<sep>she may detain but not still keep her treasure<sep>her audit though delayed answered must be<sep>and her quietus is to render thee<sep>~<sep>in the old age black was not counted fair<sep>or if it were it bore not beautys name<sep>but now is black beautys successive heir<sep>and beauty slandered with a bastard shame<sep>for since each hand hath put on natures power<sep>fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face<sep>sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower<sep>but is profaned if not lives in disgrace<sep>therefore my mistress eyes are raven black<sep>her eyes so suited and they mourners seem<sep>at such who not born fair no beauty lack<sep>slandering creation with a false esteem<sep>yet so they mourn becoming of their woe<sep>that every tongue says beauty should look so<sep>~<sep>how oft when thou my music music playst<sep>upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds<sep>with thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst<sep>the wiry concord that mine ear confounds<sep>do i envy those jacks that nimble leap<sep>to kiss the tender inward of thy hand<sep>whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap<sep>at the woods boldness by thee blushing stand<sep>to be so tickled they would change their state<sep>and situation with those dancing chips<sep>oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait<sep>making dead wood more blest than living lips<sep>since saucy jacks so happy are in this<sep>give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss<sep>~<sep>th expense of spirit in a waste of shame<sep>is lust in action and till action lust<sep>is perjured murdrous bloody full of blame<sep>savage extreme rude cruel not to trust<sep>enjoyed no sooner but despised straight<sep>past reason hunted and no sooner had<sep>past reason hated as a swallowed bait<sep>on purpose laid to make the taker mad<sep>mad in pursuit and in possession so<sep>had having and in quest to have extreme<sep>a bliss in proof and proved a very woe<sep>before a joy proposed behind a dream<sep>all this the world well knows yet none knows well<sep>to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell<sep>~<sep>my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun<sep>coral is far more red than her lips red<sep>if snow be white why then her breasts are dun<sep>if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head<sep>i have seen roses damasked red and white<sep>but no such roses see i in her cheeks<sep>and in some perfumes is there more delight<sep>than in the breath that from my mistress reeks<sep>i love to hear her speak yet well i know<sep>that music hath a far more pleasing sound<sep>i grant i never saw a goddess go<sep>my mistress when she walks treads on the ground<sep>and yet by heaven i think my love as rare<sep>as any she belied with false compare<sep>~<sep>thou art as tyrannous so as thou art<sep>as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel<sep>for well thou knowst to my dear doting heart<sep>thou art the fairest and most precious jewel<sep>yet in good faith some say that thee behold<sep>thy face hath not the power to make love groan<sep>to say they err i dare not be so bold<sep>although i swear it to my self alone<sep>and to be sure that is not false i swear<sep>a thousand groans but thinking on thy face<sep>one on anothers neck do witness bear<sep>thy black is fairest in my judgments place<sep>in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds<sep>and thence this slander as i think proceeds<sep>~<sep>thine eyes i love and they as pitying me<sep>knowing thy heart torment me with disdain<sep>have put on black and loving mourners be<sep>looking with pretty ruth upon my pain<sep>and truly not the morning sun of heaven<sep>better becomes the grey cheeks of the east<sep>nor that full star that ushers in the even<sep>doth half that glory to the sober west<sep>as those two mourning eyes become thy face<sep>o let it then as well beseem thy heart<sep>to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace<sep>and suit thy pity like in every part<sep>then will i swear beauty herself is black<sep>and all they foul that thy complexion lack<sep>~<sep>beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan<sep>for that deep wound it gives my friend and me<sep>ist not enough to torture me alone<sep>but slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be<sep>me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken<sep>and my next self thou harder hast engrossed<sep>of him my self and thee i am forsaken<sep>a torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed<sep>prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward<sep>but then my friends heart let my poor heart bail<sep>whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard<sep>thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol<sep>and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee<sep>perforce am thine and all that is in me<sep>~<sep>so now i have confessed that he is thine<sep>and i my self am mortgaged to thy will<sep>my self ill forfeit so that other mine<sep>thou wilt restore to be my comfort still<sep>but thou wilt not nor he will not be free<sep>for thou art covetous and he is kind<sep>he learned but suretylike to write for me<sep>under that bond that him as fist doth bind<sep>the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take<sep>thou usurer that putst forth all to use<sep>and sue a friend came debtor for my sake<sep>so him i lose through my unkind abuse<sep>him have i lost thou hast both him and me<sep>he pays the whole and yet am i not free<sep>~<sep>whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will<sep>and will to boot and will in overplus<sep>more than enough am i that vex thee still<sep>to thy sweet will making addition thus<sep>wilt thou whose will is large and spacious<sep>not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine<sep>shall will in others seem right gracious<sep>and in my will no fair acceptance shine<sep>the sea all water yet receives rain still<sep>and in abundance addeth to his store<sep>so thou being rich in will add to thy will<sep>one will of mine to make thy large will more<sep>let no unkind no fair beseechers kill<sep>think all but one and me in that one will<sep>~<sep>if thy soul check thee that i come so near<sep>swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will<sep>and will thy soul knows is admitted there<sep>thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil<sep>will will fulfil the treasure of thy love<sep>ay fill it full with wills and my will one<sep>in things of great receipt with case we prove<sep>among a number one is reckoned none<sep>then in the number let me pass untold<sep>though in thy stores account i one must be<sep>for nothing hold me so it please thee hold<sep>that nothing me a something sweet to thee<sep>make but my name thy love and love that still<sep>and then thou lovst me for my name is will<sep>~<sep>thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes<sep>that they behold and see not what they see<sep>they know what beauty is see where it lies<sep>yet what the best is take the worst to be<sep>if eyes corrupt by overpartial looks<sep>be anchored in the bay where all men ride<sep>why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks<sep>whereto the judgment of my heart is tied<sep>why should my heart think that a several plot<sep>which my heart knows the wide worlds common place<sep>or mine eyes seeing this say this is not<sep>to put fair truth upon so foul a face<sep>in things right true my heart and eyes have erred<sep>and to this false plague are they now transferred<sep>~<sep>when my love swears that she is made of truth<sep>i do believe her though i know she lies<sep>that she might think me some untutored youth<sep>unlearned in the worlds false subtleties<sep>thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young<sep>although she knows my days are past the best<sep>simply i credit her falsespeaking tongue<sep>on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed<sep>but wherefore says she not she is unjust<sep>and wherefore say not i that i am old<sep>o loves best habit is in seeming trust<sep>and age in love loves not to have years told<sep>therefore i lie with her and she with me<sep>and in our faults by lies we flattered be<sep>~<sep>o call not me to justify the wrong<sep>that thy unkindness lays upon my heart<sep>wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue<sep>use power with power and slay me not by art<sep>tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight<sep>dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside<sep>what needst thou wound with cunning when thy might<sep>is more than my oerpressed defence can bide<sep>let me excuse thee ah my love well knows<sep>her pretty looks have been mine enemies<sep>and therefore from my face she turns my foes<sep>that they elsewhere might dart their injuries<sep>yet do not so but since i am near slain<sep>kill me outright with looks and rid my pain<sep>~<sep>be wise as thou art cruel do not press<sep>my tonguetied patience with too much disdain<sep>lest sorrow lend me words and words express<sep>the manner of my pitywanting pain<sep>if i might teach thee wit better it were<sep>though not to love yet love to tell me so<sep>as testy sick men when their deaths be near<sep>no news but health from their physicians know<sep>for if i should despair i should grow mad<sep>and in my madness might speak ill of thee<sep>now this illwresting world is grown so bad<sep>mad slanderers by mad ears believed be<sep>that i may not be so nor thou belied<sep>bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide<sep>~<sep>in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes<sep>for they in thee a thousand errors note<sep>but tis my heart that loves what they despise<sep>who in despite of view is pleased to dote<sep>nor are mine cars with thy tongues tune delighted<sep>nor tender feeling to base touches prone<sep>nor taste nor smell desire to be invited<sep>to any sensual
